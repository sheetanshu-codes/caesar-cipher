# caesar-cipher
 Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. Caesar cipher (or Caesar's cipher) shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c.
